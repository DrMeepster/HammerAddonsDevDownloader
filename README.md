# HammerAddons Dev Downloader (HAAD)

This is a script to download the latest dev version of [TeamSpen210's HammerAddons](https://github.com/TeamSpen210/HammerAddons).

This script is made in Python 3.9. Earlier versions of Python 3 may work, but they have not been tested.

`python hadd.py -h` will list out all the options. No options are required, so you can just run `python haad.py` to build HammerAddons with the default options.

Dependencies:
 * Git
 * Python 3.9
 * A c/c++ compiler
